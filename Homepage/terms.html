            Below are the general Terms and Conditions of using this system application.
        </h1>
        <p>
            1. Users acknowledge that it is their responsibility to supply, examine, and confirm that the information
            they enter into this system in support of their application is accurate and correct. Your application may be
            suspended or rejected if you provide incorrect or inaccurate information.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Any data entered into the system is subject to data privacy/protection laws and other applicable rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. To book your slot on your preferred day and time of appointment, you must pay 30% of the total cost based
            on the service you choose.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. This appointment and scheduling system allocates slots on a first come, first served basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. If more than one customer booked an appointment at the same time and date, the reservation will go to the
            person who pays the confirmation fee first. The clinic will then contact the other patient for an
            alternative time slot.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. In order to prevent double reservations, customers who want to change their appointments are urged to
            cancel their current appointment before reserving a new time period. If a consumer makes numerous
            reservations for the same service on different days or appointments, the earliest reservation will be
            canceled, and only the most recent date of the appointment will be kept.
        </p>
        <p>
            7. For cancellations, send a notice one business day before the appointment date to process the refund of
            the confirmation fee. Cancellations made on the same day of appointment will not be eligible for refund.
        </p>
        <p>
            8. Social distancing and use of face covering are still required while inside the Consulate.
